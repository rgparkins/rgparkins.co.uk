            <p class="lead mb-5">Initially educated in Engineering, I gained 1st class degree at Loughborough but had a passion for computers and programing (ZX Spectrum!). I have
                moved from being a junior developer to now heading up the engineering and architecture division of Talent Consulting.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-5">I have worked in many 
                sectors including education, retail and insurance, in varied roles from Senior software engineer, Staff Engineer to head of Architecture. I have two passions which are 
                building simple solutions to customer problems with a speciality being in the cloud (Azure or AWS).
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-5">In the past few years I have migrated in the management side of the business, focusing more on the team management side, helping in the recruitment and building
                teams at both CompareTheMarket and Talent Consulting.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-5">Experience has given me a great understanding, that teams just don't build themselves, you need the right people
                with the right behaviours, alongside a good clear direction and career path to gain that ownership and community that successful companies foster
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-5">I am currently heading up the architecture and engineering position at Talent Consulting, building a team of permanent staff 
                to allow us to scale faster for our current and future client contracts in the public sector

                        Always looking to perform investigations into better ways of solving specific issues with
                        cloud based technology, for example serverless vs EC2, Kafka vs RabbitMQ. Spent time bringing
                        solutions to the table in terms of POC and present these to the Architecture Forum for
                        discussion. Many of these were to either increase performance for existing event driven
                        systems or expose current processes out to the business teams so they can make better decisions.
