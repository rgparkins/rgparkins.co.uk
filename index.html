                Father of 2 fantastic boys, I work and live within the Peterbough area spending time between Licolnshire and Cambrigeshire. I have been married to Nicola
                for the past year and we live with our 2 dogs, 1 cat and 8 chickens, thus finding that we have had to get a liking for eggs!

                I grew up in Shotley, Ipswich from the age of 9 (moving from Colne Engaine in Essex). I went to Holbrook High secondary school
                and progressed onto Northgate Sixth Form to take my A-levels where I was mildly successful and got entry into Loughborough University
            </p>
            <p class="full">
                I spent 4 years at Loughborough University studying Electrical &amp; Electrical Engineering where I took a year out at
                <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emerson.com">Emerson Liebert</a> working amongst the engineers designing and developing
                unniterruptible power supplies. I achieved a 1st class Honours degree and spent my first working years continuing in the electronics industry
            </p>
            <p class="full">
                In 1996 I started to get more interest in how the electronics was controlled and started to develop the embedded software used to
                control the hardware that we were designing. This interest grew and I progressed from embedded software into UI development then Java followed by .NET
                and following the tech into full SaaS with Cloud based services, REST and back end services which I am now developing and supporting at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comparethemarket.com">CompareTheMarket</a>
                using the latest tech and design practices.
