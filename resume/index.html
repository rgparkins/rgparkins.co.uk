                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>
                        I hold a 1st class honours degree in Electronic & Electrical Engineering, where my fascination with software development emerged despite the technical depth of my studies. Upon graduation, I swiftly immersed myself in the dynamic realm of embedded programming, evolving from a junior developer to embracing languages such as Java, C#, and more recently, NodeJS, as the internet landscape unfolded.</p>
                    <p>
                        Transitioning into a Solutions Architect role at CompareTheMarket allowed me to further cultivate my passion for building robust systems. My journey continued when Talent Consulting entrusted me with leading their IT team, concurrently engaging in architecting projects within the public sector, predominantly in Azure, with additional expertise in AWS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having traversed diverse sectors like education, retail, and insurance, I've donned various hats—from Senior Software Engineer to Head of Architecture. Two driving passions define my professional ethos: crafting straightforward solutions to address customer challenges and steering initiatives towards seamless transitions from on-premise to cloud, especially in the realm of greenfield cloud solutions.
                    <p>
                        In my current capacity, I engage in a dynamic blend of 70% hands-on project work, contributing to the delivery of solution and infrastructure projects in the cloud. The remaining 30% is dedicated to leadership responsibilities, where I actively nurture and build a permanent team. My focus extends beyond project execution; I am committed to instilling a culture of community practice, refining work methodologies, and implementing best practices for delivering innovative solutions to our public sector clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My rich experience has underscored a fundamental truth—teams don't organically form; they require the right individuals exhibiting the right behaviors. Coupled with clear direction and a well-defined career path, this combination cultivates a sense of ownership and community—hallmarks of success in thriving organizations.

                    <h2>Head of IT Engineering</h2>
                    <div class="subDetails">Talent Consulting (2021 - present)</div>
                    <p>
                        As the Head of Engineering at Talent Consulting, I've played a pivotal role in building a robust permanent team, ensuring the retention of valuable knowledge while our consultants engage in public sector contracts. The team has grown from its inception to a core unit of 20 professionals, spanning various disciplines, including architects, developers, dev-ops, and testing. Additionally, I collaborated in establishing the business side, comprising Delivery Managers, Business Analysts, and Product Owners, working closely with our Head of Delivery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Balancing team responsibilities at Talent, I am concurrently engaged as a Principal Architect at the Department for Education (DfE). Leading multiple projects within the Vulnerable Children and Families portfolio, I am actively involved in DD level reviews, show and tells, and the complete GDS agile process, presenting progress, ideas, and potential risks to the client.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a key member of the leadership team at Talent, I contribute to winning new business by creating presentations and responses to tenders. To date, my efforts have contributed to securing £30M of new business at the DfE, MOJ, and ESFA.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Team Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        A significant part of my role involves building a business plan for department growth, addressing specific milestones aligned with board-defined objectives. Solutions for challenges in team expansion include line management strategies, collaboration sessions, ceremonies, and a focus on employee well-being and DE&I. I presented the plan to the board, securing approval and subsequently bringing in a permanent delivery manager to assist with plan execution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regular collaboration meet-ups and monthly Talent days are essential for monitoring progress on our core product, the Talent Suite. This agile process-driven product facilitates customer engagement, generates weekly reports, aids in bid management, and offers transparency to our permanent staff across our portfolio. Our team benefits from an Azure platform subscription, encouraging exploration and learning, complemented by tools like Pluralsight and GitHub Co-pilot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Actively leading and organizing quarterly meetups, I foster collaboration on Talent's growth, emphasizing client relationships, business development, and creating enjoyable in-person interactions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Architecture & Technical (Principal Architect)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Overseeing all services on Azure platforms within the DfE, I adhere to design guidelines to ensure secure, stable, and scalable architecture. My responsibilities encompass the entire technical architecture, with a focus on clear communication and peer review by the DfE architecture review board. I produce comprehensive High & Low-Level Documentation, covering all functional and non-functional requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leading multiple teams on cloud projects at the DfE, I have been involved in integration projects and solution architecture for new platforms related to the Families and Vulnerable Children portfolio. These projects, predominantly hosted on Azure, undergo rigorous review, IT health checks, and WACG AA testing from external agencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A significant achievement involved reviewing Identity and Access Management for a public sector department, focusing on seven Azure cloud tenancies. I presented a strategic roadmap, outlining a three-year plan to consolidate into a single tenancy, streamlining network, access control, and generating annual savings exceeding £1M.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within Talent, I led our team in developing a core product to automate various aspects of our business. This includes project reporting with RAG status, prioritizing bid management, and implementing AI to enhance our responses to tenders, ultimately reducing documentation preparation time.

                    <h2>Applications Architect</h2>
                    <p class="subDetails">CompareTheMarket (2017 - 2021)</p>
                    <p>
                        As the Technical Product Owner and Lead Architect for the Pricing platform and Partner Risk Mapping service at CompareTheMarket, I played a pivotal role in overseeing these systems, regarded as the cornerstone of our business and hosted on AWS. I managed a team of 3 tech leads and a diverse group of around 20 individuals, spanning both development and business roles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My responsibilities included crafting the architectural vision for the new Pricing Platform, focusing on enhancing scalability, stability, and security while prioritizing customer-centric design principles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Serving as the lead developer, I spearheaded the migration of the pricing platform to a micro-service architecture over a two-year period. This transformation resulted in a shift from intra-month deployments to daily real-time deployments, significantly improving scalability and reducing customer downtime by 30%. Additionally, our remediation times saw notable enhancements through the implementation of more effective common monitoring dashboards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I architected and developed a new real-time quotability system, complete with Grafana dashboards, enabling swift issue detection and resolution at our providers. This initiative substantially reduced our time-to-fix from hours/days to minutes, leading to a tangible increase in revenue on a month-to-month basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the role of Chair of the Technical Forum and leader of various working groups, I contributed to the conceptualization and implementation of common initiatives across the department. The introduction of contract testing on a department-wide scale proved instrumental in reducing incidents on deployment by enabling testing against a specific set of contract tests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pioneering the concept of a service catalogue, I empowered teams to automate catalogue population. This initiative not only facilitated documentation generation but also played a crucial role in reducing the mean time to failure during incidents. Furthermore, it enabled the automation of various immunization reporting tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The introduction of automation for specific immunization tasks, hosted on our dedicated AWS GitHub Action runner and scheduled via cron timers, streamlined the scanning of each microservice repository through tools like SonarQube, Checkmarx, and OWASP Zap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My active participation in numerous tech leadership, speaking, and influencing workshops contributed valuable insights that were effectively implemented in real-world scenarios, fostering growth and innovation at CompareTheMarket.

                    <p>
                        Leading a dedicated team, I conceptualized, developed, and maintained the innovative Pricing Platform at CompareTheMarket. Prioritizing security, scalability, and diagnostic capabilities from the outset, our approach aimed for a robust and future-proof system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our system effectively supported up to 10 journey and retrieval transactions per second, hosted on AWS and utilizing technologies such as EC2, Lambda, S3, and CodeDeploy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The architecture included Swagger specifications defining REST endpoints, ensuring secure communication through bearer token authentication via OAuth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to technical leadership, a significant aspect of my role involved mentoring and guiding the career paths of the developers within the team, fostering their professional growth.
