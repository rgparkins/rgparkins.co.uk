                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>Initially educated in Electronic & Electrical Engineering, I gained 1st class degree at Loughborough but had a passion for computers and programing (ZX Spectrum!). I have
                        moved from being a junior developer to now heading up the engineering and architecture division of Talent Consulting.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have worked in many 
                        sectors including education, retail and insurance, in varied roles from Senior software engineer, Staff Engineer to head of Architecture. I have two passions which are 
                        building simple solutions to customer problems with a focus on moving from on premise to cloud as well as green field cloud solutions
                    </p>
                    <p>My current role is a mix of 70-30 hands on project work helping deliver solution and infrastructure projects in the cloud with 30% leading and building a permanent team 
                        and introducing community of practice, ways of working and best practices in the way we deliver solutions to our public sector clients</p>
                    <p>Experience has given me a great understanding, that teams just don't build themselves, you need the right people
                        with the right behaviours, alongside a good clear direction and career path to gain that ownership and community that successful companies foster.
