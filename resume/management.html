    <h2 class="h5 border-bottom pb-2">Personal Profile</h2>
    <p>
      Technical Director with 20+ years’ experience progressing from developer to architect to technology leader.
      I align technology strategy with business outcomes, build high-performing teams, and deliver secure, scalable,
      cloud-first services. As a servant leader, I remove blockers and grow people; as a visionary strategist,
      I set clear roadmaps and steer transformation across public and private sector programmes.

      delivers measurable business value. My track record spans scaling teams, modernising platforms, embedding security,
      and driving innovation across high-stakes public-sector and enterprise environments.
