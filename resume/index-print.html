                    <p class="subDetails">CompareTheMarket (2017 - present)</p>
                    <p>
                        Technical product owner for our Pricing platform and Partner Risk Mapping service. These
                        systems are the 1st class citizens of the business and hosted in AWS. Rwsponsible for 3 tech leads
                        and a developer team of around 20.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Responsible for the architectural vision for the new Pricing Platform at CompareTheMarket.
                        Focused on developing scalability, stability and security for the system, keeping the
                        customer at the centre of our business.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Moved the platform over to a micro-service architecture from on premise over a period of 2 years.
                        Went from intra month deployments to daily real time deployments and better scalability under heavy load, thus reducing our costs by 25%
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Architected and developed a new real-time quotability system allowing fast feedback of issues and problems at
                        our providers. This reduced our time-to-fix from hours/days down to minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chair of Technical forum, and many working groups, including concepting and rolling out
                        common initiatives across the department. Contract testing introduced reducing our incidents on deployment
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Introduced the concept of having a service catalogue and giving teams the power to automate the population of the catalogue. This
                        had an effect of driving generation of our documentation, allowing us to reduce the mean time to failure during incidents. Also
                        allowed us to automate a lot of the immunisation reporting
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Introduced automation of specific immunisation tasks hosted on our own AWS github action runner. Scheduled on cron timers each micro service
                        repo can be scanned via sonarqube, checkmarx and owasp zap
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Attended many tech leadership, speaking and influencing workshops where the lessons
                        learned were implemented in real world to bring people along in the journey at
                        CompareTheMarket.
